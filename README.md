# My Souls

There are several other soul plugins for spigot, however, I couldn't find any that would please my taste, so I ended up creating this open source project so surprising that it will be the last one you will be looking for on the internet.

Here's why:

* Limited number of souls per player, making the **death** of a player something to think about and not spend it for nothing.
* Use of APIs, such as **PlaceholderAPI**, **bStats** and **SinkAPI** *(coming soon)*.
* Fully configurable via YAML, to make it **unique** for each server.
* **Language files**, so that all countries understand what the plugin says
* **Open source** project, which means that the code always has updates.
* Own **Event API** for implementations in other plugins.

Of course, there aren't perfect plugins, since each need tends to be different. So I will be adding more and more features to this project. You may also suggest improvements by forking this project and creating a pull request or opening an issue

## Plugin Info

Below is the list of placeholders that the plugin offers the PlaceholderAPI extension to be used in any other plugin.:

 - %mysouls_soulscount%: returns the player's amount of souls.
 - %mysouls_soulscount_<player>%: returns the number of souls he has from a player.
 - %mysouls_playercount%: returns the number of unique players of their souls.
 - %mysouls_soulsratio%: returns the ratio from soulscount and playercount.
